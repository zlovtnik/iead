# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The church management API currently lacks authentication and authorization capabilities, making it unsuitable for production use. This feature will implement a comprehensive authentication system that allows different user roles (Admin, Pastor, Member) to access appropriate functionality while maintaining security and data privacy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a church administrator, I want to create user accounts with different roles, so that I can control who has access to sensitive church data and operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new user account THEN the system SHALL require username, email, password, and role assignment
2. WHEN a user account is created THEN the system SHALL hash the password using a secure algorithm
3. WHEN assigning roles THEN the system SHALL support Admin, Pastor, and Member role types
4. IF a user tries to create an account with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an error message
5. WHEN creating user accounts THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password strength

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a church member, I want to log in to the system with my credentials, so that I can access my personal church information securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and return a session token
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
3. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a session that expires after a configurable time period
4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session token

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control, so that users can only perform actions appropriate to their role level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin user accesses any endpoint THEN the system SHALL allow full access to all operations
2. WHEN a Pastor user accesses member/event/donation data THEN the system SHALL allow read and write access
3. WHEN a Member user accesses data THEN the system SHALL only allow access to their own records
4. WHEN a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden error
5. WHEN accessing protected endpoints without authentication THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a church member, I want to update my own profile information, so that I can keep my contact details current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member updates their profile THEN the system SHALL only allow changes to their own record
2. WHEN updating profile information THEN the system SHALL validate all input data
3. WHEN a member changes their password THEN the system SHALL require the current password for verification
4. WHEN profile updates are successful THEN the system SHALL return the updated information
5. IF profile validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a church administrator, I want to manage user accounts, so that I can deactivate accounts, reset passwords, and maintain system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin deactivates a user account THEN the system SHALL prevent that user from logging in
2. WHEN an admin resets a user's password THEN the system SHALL generate a temporary password and require change on next login
3. WHEN viewing user accounts THEN the system SHALL display user status, last login, and role information
4. WHEN an admin updates user roles THEN the system SHALL immediately apply new permissions
5. WHEN deleting a user account THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity by preserving historical records

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want session management and security features, so that the system remains secure against common attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating session tokens THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
2. WHEN storing passwords THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt or similar secure hashing with salt
3. WHEN detecting multiple failed login attempts THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
4. WHEN sessions are created THEN the system SHALL include expiration timestamps
5. WHEN API requests include authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL validate token integrity and expiration
